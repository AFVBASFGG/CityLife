Make an isometric 3D city builder, like Sim City, where I can build buildings, roads, infrastructure, etc. Building options include houses, schools, office buildings, factories, hospitals, malls, roads, parks, etc. The buildings must be connected to a road in order for them to be used. Make the game look amazing. It should be created with html, leveraging libraries open source components and assets when helpful, and can be made up of multiple files to improve modularity.

The game is different from standard Sim City in that it serves as a metaphor for the user to simulate, plan and manage their own life. Office buildings and factories represent income-generating work (with factories being current sources of income generation while offices represent capacity to sustain current work and investment and planning to secure future income), while parks, malls, and hospitals represent self-care and leisure activities. The goal is to balance work and life to maintain high happiness levels. Think of each building as a node in a network that contributes to the overall "life balance" of the player (as measured by metrics such as happiness, wellness and income). Distance between nodes,as given by the shortest distance between them by road, determine how strong the influence they have on each other. For instance, offices need people, but if they are too far from houses they will attract fewer and thus generate less revenue. Parks and hospitals increase  and wellness, but if they are too far from houses, they will be less effective. Parks and malls generate happiness but only if they are close enough to houses. Offices and factories will benefit from them in terms of helping them attract workers, however, factories will decrease happiness if they are too close to houses and parks. In practice each building will represent a task, activity or deliverable in the user's life, and the user must balance these to maintain high life balance.  Provide a bulldozer tool to remove buildings and roads and allow the user to move building around freely to change their distances and relationships.


Add a button to view a make an interactive node graph representing the relationships between buildings, their contributions to each other (diminished by distance) and to the overall life balance metrics.  

Populate the game with a small example city to start with and have it load on game start. Include a HUD that shows changes in the metrics visually.
